# Spatial Tool

The aim of this project is explore the concepts of geoinformatics
from first principles thorugh buiding a spatial tool in a 
low level programming language.

A Basis of Geospatial Analyis is geometry. The aim is to perform 
basic Geometric Analyis and topological Analyis on vector 
geospatial data.

## Some Objectives include:
    1. Parse vector geometry from GeoJSON input.
    2. Store spatial features using custom C data structures.
    3. Compute geometric properties:
            - line length
            - Polygon Perimeter
            - Polygon area
            - Minimum bounding rectangle

    4. Compute topological properties, specifically spatial 
       adjacency based on shared boundaries or vertices.
    5. Generate a summary report containing:
        - Basic dataset metadata
        - Geometric statistics
        - Topological Connectivity metrics
    6. Export the report in CSV or JSON format
    7. Provide a clear CLI usage interface.
