# spatialtool
This project implements a command-line application written in C that performs low-level geometric and topological analysis on vector geospatial data. The application supports loading vector datasets stored in GeoJSON format, stores the data in user-defined C structures, computes geometric and adjacency-based properties, and exports summarised results to a structured output file (CSV or JSON). Optional functions enable conversion of the dataset into a simplified internal JSON-based format.  The project bridges the disciplines of geoinformatics and computer science by developing GIS functionality without relying on full GIS libraries, demonstrating understanding of spatial data structures, geometry algorithms, memory management, and format handling.
